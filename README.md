By this particular problem, you can safely go for the good old loops, even if these are nested loops.<br/>
Complicating matters with Union Find, or other structures, only creates code bloat.

Choosing this approach is due to the small input constraints: a matrix with a maximum size of  250 rows x 250 columns.<br/>
These input constraints are as of the time of solving the problem, August 2022, since sometimes, for some problems, the original input constraints are changed by leetcode.
